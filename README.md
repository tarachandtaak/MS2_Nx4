Code repository for Chand et al (2022). Nx4 Modulated Resting State Functional Connectivity between Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex in a Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Trial.


The analysis relies on the different processing steps for available softwares 

1) Preprocessing and FC calculation (using conn toolbox)
2) Functional density calcuation (FCD was calcuated using DPABI toolbox)
3) Smoothing FC map and FCD map (SPM)
4) One Sample T-Test on FCD and FC map for RS0 day1 data (SPM)
5) Reapeated measure anova (SPM)
